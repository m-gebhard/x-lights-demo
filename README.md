# x-lights-demo

This is a small demo of the X-Lights Webapp.
It's only for preview purposes, there's no communication with any server, nor data persistence.
Most stuff is copied from the original app, with most of it's functionality removed, so there could be warnings / errors.
You can serve the app directly after installing the required dependencies.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies
`yarn install`

2. Start server
`yarn serve`
